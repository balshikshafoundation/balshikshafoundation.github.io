                Bāl Shiksha Foundation works to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds so they are not left behind in their education. We believe that a child’s learning and wellbeing do not exist in isolation. Every child stands at the intersection of family, school, and community. When any one of these is fragile, a child’s education is at risk. Our work places children at the centre, while engaging with the families, schools, and communities that shape their everyday lives. By strengthening these interconnected systems, we aim to create conditions where children can learn with dignity, continuity, and hope.</p>

To support underprivileged children in India through their entire educational journey from early schooling to higher education; by addressing financial, social, and systemic barriers that prevent them from continuing in education.  We believe that every child deserves access to high-quality education and, through long-term financial assistance, we aim to help them realise their full potential and shape a brighter future for themselves and their communities.

To enable access to quality education for children at risk of being left behind. To support children through financial assistance and holistic, context-aware support. To work closely with families, schools, and communities to strengthen the environments around children.

Many children in India face barriers such as poverty, migration, disability, family instability, or lack of institutional support. These challenges often disrupt schooling and make continuity fragile.

                       Children affected by poverty, instability, migration, family loss, disability or lack of support are often unable to stay in school. We want to ensure these children are not left behind. We believe that every child deserves the dignity of opportunity, Education is one of the most powerful tools for long-term change, and together, i.e. donors, communities, and supporters, we can open doors that would otherwise remain closed.

                <h2>Our Ways of Working.</h2>
<p>
Bal Shiksha Foundation does not operate through rigid hierarchies or narrowly defined roles. While each partner has areas of focus, all members contribute across activities, from conversations and planning to field visits, problem-solving, and reflection. Bal Shiksha Foundation is built as a collaborative partnership. While each member contributes in specific ways, the Foundation works collectively; responsibilities overlap, conversations are shared, and decisions are shaped together. All members contribute across activities as needed, guided by context, capacity, and shared intent.</p>
